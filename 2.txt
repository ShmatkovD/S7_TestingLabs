    - A lot of OS are experimental and do not used almost at all
    - There are a lot of old versions of OS (Windows 95). Engineers had to port

    - Bad logic of saving data because a lot of similar informations will be
        in one file and a lot of such files will be generated for database.

        1) We limit maximal size of field
        2) We save size of field before the data

3.
    - Data access problems appear when at least 2 applications try to read (write)
        data from 1 file
    - When one application will read data and then data will be changed by other,
        problems with data reliability would appear.
